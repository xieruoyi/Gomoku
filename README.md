# AI Engine for Gomoku
This project designs an AI engine for the game Gomoku, where users are aimed to place a horizontal, vertical or diagonal sequence of 5 stones on a 8 x 8 board, when alternatively placing a stone on an empty space. The game follows all the rules presented in the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku.

The file gomoku.py contains the following primary functions:

print_board: prints out the game board.

is_empty: checks if the current board is empty (i.e., no stone on the board).

is_bounded: checks the status of the given sequence and report if it is OPEN, SEMIOPEN, or CLOSED.

search_max: advises on what the optimal move for Black (which is the computer) is.

detect_row: returns the number of OPEN and SEMI-OPEN sequences of the chosen color that are contained, given the direction, start and end of a sequence

detect_rows: different from the function detect_row, it searches the number of OPEN and SEMI-OPEN sequences of the chosen color that present in the entire board.

analysis: computes the number of OPEN and SEMI-OPEN sequences of both colors in the entire board.

is_win: returns the current status of the game if either of the player wins, a draw is reached, or they should continue playing.
